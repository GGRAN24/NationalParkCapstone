## Motivation:
As a highly adventurous female with a love of nature, I want to explore as many National Parks as possible.  I have however, 
often asked myself how safe the parks are regardless of demographics, geographic location, or activity.  I wanted to analyze 
a region of National Parks that is becoming more popular and I myself and often drawn to, and uncover some truths about deaths 
in natures playground.

## Questions:
1) Which National Parks in the Intermountain region have the most deaths from years 2007 - 2023?
2) How have fatality trends in the national parks shifted from 2007 to 2023, analyzing total deaths, causes of death and park locations? 

## Normalizing the Data
There were many data sets I selected from the main source which I then cleaned and merged as needed to compile the desired 
information. There was some data I originally cleaned and merged regarding species in the parks, that I later realized was
not as relevant to my questions as I expected.  I kept the data in my notebook for the ability to analyze at another time.  

## Challenges and Hurdles
It was a challenge to take such large data sets and merge them concisely into manageable and effective smaller sets for analysis.
Due to the high number of visitors as compared to deaths, it was also challenging to normalize the data while still being able to see 
the numbers in a meaningful way.Early years of data do not appear to include some values concerning causes of death, and may have affected
certain outcomes so were not included or were accounted for in the presentation.

## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas for normalizing and aggregating data
2) Canva - for presentation of project  
3) Git - for version control
4) Webscraping - Elevation data
5) Power BI Dashboarding

## Data Sources
1) National Park Service: NPS.gov
The main source for data including visitors numbers, fatalities,  and causes of death.

 a) https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park
 b) https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/Search/SpeciesList
 c) https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/mortality-data.htm

2) Wikipedia (web-scrapped Highest and lowest points in ech US National Park article)
https://en.m wikipedia.org

3) International Search and Rescue Incident Database

## Conclusion
Although park safety is sensationalized in the media, statistics show that compared to the number of visitors to 
the IMR National Parks, the death rate is quite low.  Even more interesting is the fact that while you may think 
deaths in the natural untamed environments are nature related, they are more often a result of human behavior or natural causes. 
Further analysis comparing regions would be interesting and may also allow for more questions requiring answers.
